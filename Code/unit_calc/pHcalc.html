	CALCULATION EXPLENATION. 
	FIRST: DETERMINING HOW MANY MOLES OF BASE I WILL NEED TO NEUTRALIZE. MOLES H+ = 10^(-pH). SO
	TARGET pH - ORIGINAL pH = NUMBER OF H+ TO GET TO HE DESIRED pH.
	
	SECOND: DETERMINING HOW MANY MOLES OF THE ADDITIVE IS NEEDED TO NEUTRALIZE THE pH. SINCE ONE 
	MOLE OF THE ADDITIVE CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE H+ THUS ONE MORE OF ADDITIVE NEUTRALIZING MORE 
	THAN ONE MOLE OF BASE, DIVIDE THE NEEDED MOLES OF H+ BY HOW MANY H+ THE ADDITIVE HAS. WITH THIS
	A 1 TO 1 RATIO OF MOLES ADDITIVE TO H+ NEEDED IS DETERMINED. MULTIPLYING THE 1 TO 1 RATIO BY
	THE MOLAR MASS OF THE ADDITIVE GETS US THE MASS OF THE ADDITIVE NEEDED.
	
	THIRD: THE MOLARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO ADD IS SMIMPLE CONVERSIONS OF MOLES/LITERS = MOLARITY.
	EQUIVELENTLY SUBSTITUTING CHANGE IN PLACE OF MOLES YOU GET CHANGE CHANGE/MOLARITY = LITERS
*/

//	THIS WILL CALCULATE HOW MANY ML OF .01M CONCENTRATION YOU WILL NEED TO GET TO THE pH !!PER LITER!!
//	.01 is the molarity so that is (change/molarity but since this is usually measured in ml, dividing by .001
