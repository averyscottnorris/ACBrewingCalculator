  *The formula used will determine your initial carbonation based on CO2s solubility vs temperature chart.

  **corn sugar is fully consumed by the yeast, this is not true for all sugars. For other sugars, find what percent of it is consumped and divide the grams of dextrose by that percent to determine how many grams of that sugar you need.
