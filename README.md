# ACBrewingCalculator
Google Chrome extension that provides brewers with a brewing calculator

#Cody + Avery
We have done some work on the layout of how are program will work. We
pland to have this as an extension for chrome. We plan to have some 
simple calculators work in a drop downlist and display in the drop down
while larger/more complicated calculators will open a new window in a
seperate website, use Javascript to interface with the user and run CGIs.

# Third week update Cody Leytham
I am working on the .cpp files that will be converted into the .cgi files
for the Javascript to invoke.

I have currently wrote very little code but given the nature of my taks
 (writing the .cpp files for the calculators/convertors) right now I am
doing more on researching and planning out the formulas. Once I get all
of this down on paper it will probably take little time to code. It will
mostly be getting data from a user, then doing the calculation and returning
the values. So I have done more work that it appears in the files.
