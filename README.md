# Limitations
This is an unfinished product and limitations are unknown but 
for many of the applications, it will be limited to realistic
values and data. Ex: dont use unrealisticly small pH values
on the pH adjustment calculator. There is also rounding that
assumed there is a realistic margin of error. Ex: the pH
calculator rounds 5 gallons up to 20 liters from 18.9 incurring
a 5.5% error wich is acceptable in home brewing.
